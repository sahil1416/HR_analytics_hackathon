Project: Predictive Model for Employee Promotions at MNC (Analytics Vidhya Hackathon)

Objective: Developed a predictive model to identify employees eligible for promotion, optimizing the promotion cycle and reducing delays in transitioning to new roles.

Data Analysis:
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify key features impacting promotion decisions.
Addressed class imbalance in the target variable to ensure robust model performance.

Feature Engineering:
Created new features based on employee performance metrics, demographics, and training program outcomes.
Assessed feature importance to enhance model accuracy.

Model Development:
Implemented and compared various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Applied cross-validation techniques for hyperparameter tuning and to prevent overfitting.

Evaluation:
Selected the best model based on the F1 Score, the competition's evaluation metric.
Achieved an F1 Score of 50.19%, placing in the top 10% of participants.

Impact:
Streamlined the promotion process by accurately identifying potential promotees early in the cycle.
Reduced transition delays for promoted employees, improving organizational efficiency.
